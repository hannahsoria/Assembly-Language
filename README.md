# Assembly-Language

Description:
The goal of this project was to create a python assembler that takes in human readable text files and put out the binary instructions that are readable by the CPU. To do this the first function reads in a file and tokenizes it meaning separating the file into a a string separated by spaces. It also converts everything to lowercase. The instructions contain labels which are targets for branching instructions. The output of this is a list of lists and each sublist is a line of instructions. The first pass then figures out which line number goes with which label and returns  a list of instructions and a dictionary of labels with the line number as the corresponding value. The second pass then goes through every line in the list and goes through if statements that determine the op code and then the rest of the corresponding code, then adds the binary instruction to a new list. Lastly, the list is printed out in the format of a mif file. To read in the mif I copied the printed instructions into a different text file which through command instructions is copied into a mif then run with the CPU.
